Set variable of each nod 
list of the pum which can produce [2,4,5,6]
Number the node from 1 to 6  
Set the inflow and outflow values in each nod 
call the value of array of each station to be use
   If the inflow > the outflow
    Print ( result will same outflow )
  Else inflow < than outflow 
    Print (result will same as inflow) 
    
Sum of nod 4 & nod 5 

Assume the answer of sum is the final answer of node 6
